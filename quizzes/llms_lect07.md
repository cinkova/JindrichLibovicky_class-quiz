# Large Language Models: Lecture 7 Quiz

## Evaluation of LLaMa on multiple choice questions showed that it is very sensitive to exact prompt formulation.

1. LLaMa's performance is unaffected by the way prompts are formulated.
2. (X) LLaMa requires careful prompt design to achieve optimal performance.
3. LLaMa performs equally well with any prompt as long as the context is clear.
4. LLaMa's sensitivity to prompts varies depending on the decoding algorithm.

## When building a chat for question answering...

1. Finding the correct document and searching for the answer within the document are equally challenging.
2. It is more difficult to search for the answer within the document than to find the document itself.
3. (X) Getting the correct document is more challenging than finding the answer once you have the document.
4. Both tasks are simple with advanced language models.

## Why is GPT-4 often used to evaluate outputs of natural language generation?

1. GPT-4 is used because it is the most replicable way of evaluation.
2. Other LLMs can follow instructions, using GPT-4 is just convention.
3. (X) GPT-4 is particularly known for its capability to follow fine-grained instructions.
4. GPT-4 is the only model that can handle low-resource languages effectively.

## What is one of the biggest challenges in simultaneous speech translation?

1. (X) Deciding when to wait or translate, to balance the latency and quality.
2. Distinguishing speech and silence.
3. Different speed of speech in different languages.
4. The computation time of the text-to-text translation.
