		<text>The weight update in SGD for logistic regression is</text>

		<answer correct="true">$(y(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{w}) - t_i)\boldsymbol{x}_i$</answer>
		<answer>$\sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{w})\left(1 - \sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T) \right)\boldsymbol{x}_i$</answer>
		<answer>$\nabla_\boldsymbol{x} -\log \sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{w})^t_i \cdot (1 - \sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{w}))^{1 - t_i}$</answer>
		<answer>$-t_i\boldsymbol{x}_i$ if $t_i \boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{w} &lt; 0$</answer>

	<question>
		<text>Select a false statement about the softmax function</text>

		<answer>$\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \frac{\exp \boldsymbol{x}}{\sum_i \exp x_i}$</answer>
		<answer>Softmax is invariant towards shift: $\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{x} + c) = \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{x})$</answer>
		<answer correct="true">Softmax is invariant towards shift: $\operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{x} + c) = \operatorname{softmax}(\boldsymbol{x})$ + c</answer>
		<answer>Softmax yields a categorical distribution.</answer>

	<question>
		<text>Generalized linear models</text>

		<answer correct="true">Are a special case of neural networks with zero hidden layers.</answer>
		<answer>Always have the optimum analytical solution on training data.</answer>
		<answer>With $D$-dimensional input have the same number of parameters as a multi-layer perceptron with $D$-dimensional input and $D$ hidden units.</answer>
		<answer>Can only work with linear features, they do not converge with polynomial features.</answer>
	</question>

	<question>
		<text>The hidden layer of MLP $\boldsymbol{h}$</text>

		<answer>Can be interpreted as automatic features extraction from $\boldsymbol{x}$. Vector $\boldsymbol{h}$ is a logarithm of a multinomial distribution over the so called hidden features.</answer>
		<answer correct="true">$\boldsymbol{h} = a(\boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{W} + b)$ where $a$ is the activation function.</answer>
		<answer>$\boldsymbol{h} = \lambda\boldsymbol{x}_A + (1 - \lambda)\boldsymbol{x}_B$ for all $A$, $B$ such that $t_A = t_B$ (i.e., $\boldsymbol{x}_A$ and $\boldsymbol{x}_B$ belong to the same class).</answer>
		<answer>Is only used during training. At inference time, it is removed (hidden) and MLP behaves as a linear model.</answer>

	<question>
		<text>Select a false statement about activation functions in multi-layer perceptron.</text>

		<answer>The activation functions must be continuous (almost everywhere), so we can use SGD for training.</answer>
		<answer>The most frequently used activation functions for hidden layers are $\tanh$ and $\operatorname{ReLU}$.</answer>
		<answer>One of the problems with sigmoid as activation function is that $\sigma'(0) = \frac{1}{4}$.</answer>
		<answer correct="true">Identity is the best activation function because it is has a constant derivation. This helps avoiding gradients smaller than 1.</answer>
